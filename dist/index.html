                <h2>About the cannabinoids</h2>
                <p>
                    Δ8-THC (Δ8-tetrahydrocannabinol) is a federally legal substance with the same chemical composure as Δ9-THC, the main psychoactive component in marijuana that causes a high. THC causes a high for the user because it binds to the CB1 and CB2 receptors in the brain. The difference between Δ8-THC and Δ9-THC is the chemical structure, with one double bond being shifted. Δ8-THC has similar psychoactive effects to that of Δ9-THC, with users generally reporting that Δ8-THC feels about half as strong as Δ9-THC. A user's tolerance level to psychoactive cannabinoids greatly determines the experience they will have, and so an individual who has never used any kind of THC product may experience a strong high with even small amounts of Δ8-THC or Δ9-THC.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Δ8-THC-O (or Δ8-THC-O acetate) is an analogue of Δ8-THC, meaning it is very chemically similar. The difference is the addition of the acetate molecule bonded to the Δ8-THC. This addition changes the pharmakokinetics and binding affinity at the CB1 and CB2 receptors of the substance, and results in a stronger high. There is little data on the potency of THC-O, but users typically report THC-O being about 2-3x stronger than THC.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Δ9-THCP (Δ9-tetrahydrocannabiphorol) is almost chemically identical to Δ9-THC, the main psychoactive compound in cannabis, but it differs by having two extra carbon atoms on the carbon side chain. The addition of these carbon atoms, extending the <i>pentyl</i> side chain to a <i>heptyl</i> side chain, result in a much stronger binding affinity at the CB1 and CB2 receptors in the brain, causing a significantly stronger high. The binding affinity of Δ9-THCP has been measured, and it has an affinity 33x that of Δ9-THC. This theorhetically means that 33x less Δ9-THCP is needed to achieve the same effects of Δ9-THC. Therefore, 31mg of Δ9-THCP would be roughly equivalent in its effects on the user to that of 1023mg of Δ9-THC.
                </p>

                    CBD (cannabidiol) is a non-psychoactive cannabinoid that produces calming effects by binding to the cannabinoid (CB1 and CB2) receptors in your brain.

                <h2>Legality</h2>
                <p>The 2018 Farm Bill, sponsored by Republican Senator Mitch McConnel, and signed into law by former President Trump, legalized hemp plants and all parts of it, with the stipulation that any part of the plant must remain under 0.3% Δ9-THC on a dry-weight basis. Since Δ8-THC is naturally found in hemp, it is federally legal. A federal district court has also ruled in favor of the legality of cannabinoids other than Δ9-THC. The DEA has also stated that Δ8-THC is not illegal at the federal level. Several states have made Δ8-THC products illegal. Local municipalities may also choose to enforce a ban on Δ8-THC or similar products. Always check the legality of the product you are buying in your own state and city. The legality of Δ8-THC is still disputed, and is considered a legally-gray area. There are legal risks involved with the possession of any type of THC. Typically, possession of CBD poses very low legal risk. However, the same level of caution should be employed as with THC.</p>
